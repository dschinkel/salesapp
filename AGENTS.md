## Core Project Documentation
Treat the following files as the authoritative sources for project state and behavior:

- **Source of Truth:** `@PROJECT_SPEC.md`
  - Consult this first to understand feature requirements, technical stack, and design goals.

- **Behavioral & Style Manual:** `@GUIDELINES.md`
  - **Mandatory:** Follow all coding standards, architectural patterns, and naming conventions defined here.
  - Check this file before refactoring or implementing new logic to ensure compliance with project norms.

- **Mandatory Progress Log:** `@tasks.md`
  - This is the ledger for all active and completed work.
  - **Rule:** Before beginning work, identify the relevant task ID.
  - **Rule:** Upon completing a piece of behavior, update this file immediately with a status change and brief summary.

## Project Setup & Bootstrapping
Before performing any feature work or refactoring, ensure the project environment is initialized:

- **Standing Order:** If the project root lacks standard scaffolding (e.g., missing `src/` or `tailwind.config.js`):
  - **Action:** Execute `../react-app-boilerplate/init.sh`.
  - **Goal:** Establish baseline scaffolding, run `yarn install`, and create a private GitHub repository.
  - **Constraint:** Use a "Safe Merge" strategy (via rsync -au) to preserve existing newer files in the destination.
  - **Verification:** Confirm `node_modules/` exists and a new remote origin is linked via the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

---

## Git & Remote Automation
- **Repository Setup:** If the local repo is not linked to GitHub, create a new private remote repository named after the current directory and perform the initial push.
- **Yarn First:** Always use `yarn` for managing packages. If `package.json` is modified, run `yarn install` immediately.
- **Auto-Sync:** After completing any task in `tasks.md`, verify the project is in a clean state and push the current branch to GitHub.

## Agent Behavioral Rules (Self-Review)
Before finalizing any task, you must perform a self-audit against the following checklist:

1. **Guideline Compliance:** Does the code strictly follow the patterns in `GUIDELINES.md`? (e.g., naming, file structure, error handling).
2. **Spec Alignment:** Does the implementation fulfill the specific requirements in `PROJECT_SPEC.md` without adding "gold-plating" (unrequested features).
3. **No Regressions:** Did you ensure that existing logic or boilerplate functionality remains intact?
4. **Documentation Sync:** Did you update `tasks.md` to reflect the current state of this behavior?
5. **Clean Up:** Remove all temporary logs, `TODO` comments, or unused imports introduced during the iteration.

---

## Continuous Integration (Junie Brave Mode Only)
- **Auto-Commit:** After completing any behavior that modifies files, perform a local commit with a descriptive message referencing the Task ID.
- **Auto-Push:** If the session is successful and basic checks pass, push the current branch to the remote origin.
- **Branding:** Ensure the generated README.md contains the "Name Bin" project header if it is a new repository.

## For all code being written:
Most importantly, follow [The Four Rules of Simple Design](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html)

1. Passes the tests - all tests must pass
2. Reveals intention - good naming of functions and variables
3. No duplication
4. Fewest elements - don't create unecessary classes/functions, but balance against readbility and conciseness

### Test code specific rules
* All new code has test coverage for all branches
* Tests should be concise - ideally <= 5 lines
* At a glance, it should be obvious what is unique about the test
