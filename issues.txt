Lately the llm is overwriting things
    - I told it to add a new feature in project_spec.md and it renamed an existing one instead and so it removed that existing spec
    - It has done this several times, something it has never done in the past projects, so be aware of that

Usually the llm reads GUIDELINES.md and follows the outside-in TDD properly meaning it starts TDD'ing at the React Hook Layer
    - But for this project, it started with high up UI tests, not sure why, again this has never happened in 4 projects that I've used these guidelines for in the past

 It usually appends each plan to the tdd.log after it's done implementing a feature.  But again weird, it did not this time for this project.  It has in past projects

It won't stop auto commit / push. I told it to first stop and show me the commit message.

AGENTS.md and GUIDELINES.md talks about tdd.log yet when we started the project, it didn't even check to see that we had a tdd.log which we did not. And it did not created it nor did it log anything obviously
  - P0.5 If the user tells you to proceed, append the approved PLAN into `tdd.log` before starting implementation (only applies when the user chooses a TDD workflow).
  - P0.5.1 When copying the PLAN into `tdd.log`, include the full PLAN text verbatim under a `PLAN:` heading.
  - P0.8 If the user reverts an implemented plan, remove the corresponding plan and its workflow entries from `tdd.log` (only applies when the user chooses a TDD workflow).

It didn't wire up the useQuestions hook even though the plan had a step to do that: 3.Final UI Integration

It's writing bad tests
It's adding unecessary fakes and using Jest mocks, we just need simple stubs without jest.fn()
